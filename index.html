      <h3><b>✶ Passions & Aspirations ✶</b></h3>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>My passions are deeply rooted in the fine arts, specially traditional painting, where I've learned the value of detail and storytelling trough visual expression. I aspire to transform this foundation into a professional path that will allow me to expand my creativity. Personally, I want to do this through tattooing, makeup artistry and digital design. As I continue to grow my skills in software development, I am excited to merge art and technology! Using digital tools to design concepts, create interactive visuals and develop platforms that showcase my work. I aim to create meaninful experience that combine creativity and innovation.</p>

      <h4><b>Get to know me</b></h4>
      <p> Even though I am currently living in Oregon, I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. A place that I will always cheerish and remember with a smile.  After 16 years old I started traveling and became really interested in learning other languages. Currently, I am fluent in Spanish, which is my mother tongue, and English. Besides that, I thought myself Korean around the age I started traveling and because of that I am able to read it. Although, I am out of practice so my conversational skills are not that great. Amongst some of the places I've visited are different cities around Europe and The United States.
        Something that is known about me is my love for animals, as a young girl and gorwing up, I was constantly surrounded by a wide variety of animals which made me appreciate and love them all equally (Even though I am a little biased in favor of cats...).  </p>
